## üìÇ Project Structure
The project is organized into a modular folder structure to keep the codebase clean and manageable:

```
/docu-align-app
|-- documentation_app.py      # Main Streamlit application file
|-- README.md                 # Project documentation
|-- .env                      # Environment variables for API keys
|
|-- /components               # Contains all agent-related logic
|   |-- __init__.py
|   |-- agents.py             # Agent and Runner class definitions
|   |-- prompts.py            # Agent prompt instructions
|   |-- analyzer.py           # The Document Analyzer agent
|   |-- enforcer.py           # The Style Enforcer agent
|
|-- /style                    # Contains UI and styling files

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user uploads or pastes two pieces of content:  
   - a document to analyze  
   - a new piece of content to be styled  

2. **Orchestration**: `documentation_app.py` orchestrates the workflow, calling the agents in a sequence.  

3. **Agent 1 ‚Äì Document Analyzer**:  
   Analyzes the existing document‚Äôs style and tone based on instructions in `prompts.py`.  

4. **Agent 2 ‚Äì Style Enforcer**:  
   Uses the analysis from the first agent to rewrite the new content, ensuring it conforms to the identified style.  

5. **Output**: The final, polished document is displayed to the user in the Streamlit UI.
